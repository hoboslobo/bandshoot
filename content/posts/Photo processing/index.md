How much processing do you do? 

Do you abandon a photo without trying to process it? 

Here is an example. 

![Charlie Before](before.jpg "Before")

This was taken as an afterthought at the end of the shoot, and the original did not jump out at me during the initial review.

But there was a very nice catch-light in his right eye, so I decided to give it a go.

![Charlie After](after.jpg "After")

Turned out quite nice I think.
